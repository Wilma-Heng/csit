## Internships

CSIT offers internship projects to undergraduates, polytechnic and ‘A’ Level students.

As an intern in CSIT, you will be guided by a project mentor, and will gain valuable skills, knowledge and experience in infocomm technologies. Interns may be offered a scholarship or the opportunity to join CSIT upon graduation.

Our internships are available to Singaporean students studying in local polytechnics, as well as in local or overseas universities, who are majoring in Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Infocomm Technology and/ or equivalent disciplines.

You may apply directly to CSIT or via your institution’s internship exercise.
