## Who We Are

The Centre for Strategic Infocomm Technologies (CSIT) was established in 2003. We are an agency in the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) that conducts R&D in infocomm and infosecurity technologies.

CSIT has a strong focus in cyber security and data analytics. We nurture technical talents in these areas to meet Singapore’s security needs.

In our efforts to develop robust solutions for Singapore’s security needs, CSIT leverages on commercial expertise and works closely with local research institutions, defence R&D and support organisations, and startup companies.
